# Maji Ndogo Water Source Improvement Project

## Problem Statement
Maji Ndogo faces a huge problem of providing safe drinking water for its population, with significant disparities across provinces, towns and rural areas. Data-driven insights are needed to prioritize interventions and investments that will most effectively and equitably improve access to basic water services.

## Data
- Water source registry
- Project progress logs
- Population & access metrics

## Tools Used
- SQL (data extraction & aggregation)
- Python (EDA, validation)
- Power BI (dashboarding)

## Key Questions Answered

### Access & Equity
1. Which provinces and towns have the lowest access to basic water services?
2. How does water access compare between rural and urban areas?
3. Which communities are most underserved by safe water sources?
4. Are fast-growing towns falling behind in water access?
### Water Sources & Reliability
5. What types of water sources are most commonly used in low-access areas?
6. Which water sources break down or fail most often?
7. Which sources provide the most reliable water over time?
### Infrastructure & Maintenance
8. How many water sources are currently not working or only partly working?
9. Where do water infrastructure failures happen most often?
10. How long does it usually take to fix or upgrade a broken water source?
### Investments & Impact
11. Which upgrades (repairs, filters, new taps, wells) improve access the most?
12. Which provinces show the biggest improvement after investments?
13. Where has spending had little or no impact on water access?
### Trends & Planning
14. How has access to basic water services changed over time?
15. Which areas are at risk of falling behind in water access in the future?
